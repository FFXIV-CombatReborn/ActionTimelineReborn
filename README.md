Action Timeline Reborn is a community-driven fork of a fork of the original Action Timeline plugin for Final Fantasy XIV. It aims to enhance your gameplay by providing a real-time action timeline useful for seeing GCD delay, oGCD weaving, and GCD clipping.

## Features

- **Timeline**: A sophisticated on-screen map timeline showing time between GCDs and which abilties were used, as well as animationlock for each abiltiy. Useful for tuning timing settings for [Rotation Solver Reborn](https://github.com/FFXIV-CombatReborn/RotationSolverReborn)
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple, straightforward, customizable UI you can lock in place out of sight ready for when you need it.
- **Regular Updates**: Committed to staying current with the latest game patches, class updates, and community feedback.
